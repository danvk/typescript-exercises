# Notes

## Exercise 0

Exercise 0 is extremely easy, but maybe good as a way to get everything set up?

The annotation on `users` is optional.

## Exercise 1

Introduces union types.

## Exercise 2

Not clear what he's trying to introduce here:
`in` for refinement, user-defined type guards, tagged unions?

(From the hint it seems to be `in`.)

The annotation on `additionalInformation` in `logPerson` is not required.

## Exercise 3

Introduces user-defined type guards, I think? But at the same time as a tag.
Maybe building up to tagged unions?

```ts
let additionalInformation: string = '';
```

Is kinda ugly.

## Exercise 4

Says it introduces mapped types (in the hint) but these are not necessary.
You can solve the problem using `Partial` and the bonus using `Omit`.
It took me a minute to figure out what the bonus was asking, but I like it.
The `as (keyof Criteria)` in `filterUsers` is ugly but I think unavoidable.

## Exercise 5

I started using conditional types but then looked at the hint link and realized
he wanted me to use an overload. Redoing this with conditional types would be a
good extension.

I'm curious why he doesn't make more thorough use of `return`-less arrow functions.

Bonus exercise: author does not understand why `Object.keys` returns `string[]`.
I think this is also somewhat misguided since it just hides a type assertion.

"cast it" â†’ "use a type assertion"

This would be a good opportunity to use `@ts-expect-error`:

```ts
// @ts-expect-error
let astronautAdmins: Admin[] = filterPersons(persons, 'admin', { occupation: 'Astronaut' });
```

This shows the problem with overloading:

```ts
let peopleOfAge23: Person[] = filterPersons(
  persons, Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'user' : 'admin', {age: 23}
);
```
